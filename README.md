Arrays are a common mechanism for implementing data structures. In this project, you will explore and use arrays extensively, including creating arrays, accessing elements, and computing some basic stats on arrays of numbers, including min, max, average, range, and mode. The internal array used will be of a fixed size.
Exception handling, JUnit testing, Java Doc comments.
Keep track of Size of array and Capacity separately.
